NAME
    psperl

SYNTAX
    psperl [-Command]
    psperl [-Command <string>]

VERBS
    -Available
        The `Available` command will grab the list of releases from 
        Strawberry Perl's JSON file:
        http://strawberryperl.com/releases.json
        and parse out which releases are available in Portable form
        -release types found here:
        http://strawberryperl.com/releases.html
    -Init
        The Init command is usually just added to your $Profile so that psperl
        is always in your PowerShell's $env:Path environment variable. From
        that point, you could just run any other psperl command.
    -Install <string>
        Once you've selected which version of Perl you'd like to use
        from the list supplied in the `Available` command, you'd just need
        to install it.
        This command will download the Portable Perl zip file from
        Strawberry Perl's site, store it locally, check its checksum,
        unzip it, and have it available to use later.
    -List
        Show a listing of which Perls are currently installed. An asterisk
        (*) indicates the version currently in use.
    -Setup
        Ensure all directories are in place, and that you have $Profile setup
        and in place. It will add a few lines to your $Profile to initialize
        the application and ensure everything's in your $env:Path correctly.
    -Switch <string>
        Change your current environment setup to use any version of
        Perl already installed. This will be made persistent as we'll
        store the current version in our local config directory and
        every time you start a PowerShell session, we'll setup your
        environment for the selected version of Perl.
        You can change which Perl you're using as many times as you'd
        like during a session, though you can only use one Perl at a
        time.
    -Use <string>
        Almost exactly the same as the `Switch` command. However, it's not
        persistent.
        With this command, we just start using a different version of Perl,
        but we haven't switched our preference to that one. If the current
        preference is Perl v5.28 and it's what is setup to start on
        PowerShell sessions, we could temporarily use Perl v5.30 with this
        command. If the session's closed and re-opened, it'll be back on
        Perl v5.28.
        You can change which Perl you're using as many times as you'd
        like during a session, though you can only use one Perl at a
        time.
    -Version
        Displays the verson of PSPerl you're currently using.
